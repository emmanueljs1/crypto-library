<h1>Crypto Library</h1>

This is essentially a Python library that
you can use to encrypt strings; featuring a web app written using Flask for
encrypting / decrypting strings without having to write any Python code
(if you're into that sort of stuff). The library allows the user to
encrypt a stirng one of three ways: using symmetric authentic cryptography,
AES, or a simple LFSR algorithm
